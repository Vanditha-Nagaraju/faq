  A registered user can see the list of all another registered users. (except himself/herself) ( The user will be able to see the list of the users to follow once he registers and logs in)
  A user will be able to follow other registered users in the list. (except himself/herself)
  A user can unfollow users whom he/she has previously followed .
  The user can see whom he/she is following or being followed by clicking on 'My Profile' (From the drop-down on the right top of the home page). The count gets updated as the people the user follows/being followed.
